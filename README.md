This repository contains documentation related to the REST APIs and Data Visualization project in which I participated.

Project Description

Throughout the project, an analysis of stock market data was conducted using an API to retrieve historical data for various companies. The developed code allows users to select the tickers of companies of interest, subsequently obtaining data on their stock performance. The collected data was stored in separate JSON files and then merged into a single CSV file for better management and analysis. Subsequently, the temporal evolution of closing prices for each company was visualized using the Matplotlib library. This project provided a valuable learning opportunity, enabling the acquisition of skills in retrieving, manipulating, and visualizing financial data, laying a solid foundation for analysis and research in the financial sector.
